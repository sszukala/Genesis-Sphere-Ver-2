# 🛣️ Genesis-Sphere Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Genesis-Sphere framework, tracking progress on key objectives and potential applications.

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

- [ ] Explore time-space distortions during cosmic evolution
- [ ] Model behavior near singularities with simple, interpretable math
- [ ] Build tools or simulations for visualizing time-density spheres
- [ ] Develop alternate cosmological insights using modulated functions

## 🔬 Potential Applications

- [ ] Simulating gravitational lensing using sinusoidal distortions
- [ ] Modeling early universe inflation and contraction
- [ ] Creating cyclic or bouncing universe models
- [ ] Exploring entropy flow and dark energy expansion zones

## 📅 Phase Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q2-Q3 2025)
- [x] Define mathematical framework
- [x] Create initial proof-of-concept simulations
- [x] Document core equations and principles

### Phase 2: Implementation (Q4 2025)
- [x] Develop visualization tools
- [ ] Build computational models
- [ ] Validate against existing cosmological data

### Phase 3: Application (Q1-Q2 2026)
- [ ] Apply framework to specific cosmic phenomena
- [ ] Publish findings and methodology
- [ ] Explore interdisciplinary applications

## 📚 Resources Needed

- [ ] Computational resources for simulations
- [ ] Cosmological datasets for validation
- [ ] Collaboration with physics and math specialists
- [ ] Visualization expertise for complex data representation

## 🛠️ Development Setup & Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# FFmpeg Installation (required for animations)
# Windows: 
# 1. Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html or https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases
# 2. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., C:\FFmpeg)
# 3. Add the bin folder to your PATH:
#    - Right-click on "This PC" → Properties → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables
#    - Edit the Path variable and add the path to FFmpeg's bin folder (e.g., C:\FFmpeg\bin)
#    - Restart your command prompt/terminal after updating PATH
# 
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Running Simulations
```bash
# Navigate to simulations directory
cd simulations

# Run the basic simulation (static image)
python genesis_sphere_simulation.py

# Run the animated simulation (requires FFmpeg for video output)
python genesis_sphere_animation.py

# Alternative animation script with fallback (works without FFmpeg)
python genesis_sphere_animation_fallback.py

# For Jupyter notebook users
jupyter notebook genesis_sphere_notebook.ipynb
```
