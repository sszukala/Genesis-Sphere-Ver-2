# üìê Mathematical Framework

The Genesis-Sphere framework defines a novel structure for space-time geometry based on time-evolving density and modulated temporal flow. This section formalizes the variables, equations, and assumptions used in the model.

| $v_0$       | Initial unmodulated velocity                     |
| $p_0$       | Initial unmodulated pressure                     |
| $v(t)$      | Time-modulated velocity                          |

### üî¢ 2. Core Equations

#### Time-Density Geometry Function

$$
\rho(t) = \underbrace{\frac{1}{1 + \sin^2(\omega t)}}_{S(t)} \cdot \underbrace{(1 + \alpha t^2)}_{D(t)}
$$

- $S(t)$ = Sinusoidal projection factor  
- $D(t)$ = Dimension expansion factor

This function models how space-time density evolves based on periodic compression and quadratic spatial complexity.

---

#### Temporal Flow Ratio Function

$$
Tf(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \beta(|t| + \epsilon)}
$$

This function slows down the flow of time near $t = 0$ (e.g. singularities), and asymptotically approaches 1 as time increases.

---

### üìò 3. Derived Functions

#### Modulated Velocity

$$
v(t) = v_0 \cdot Tf(t)
$$

#### Modulated Pressure

$$
p(t) = p_0 \cdot \rho(t)
$$

These show how initial velocity and pressure are affected by local time distortion and density scaling.

### üìà 4. Function Behavior & Properties

- **Sinusoidal projection**: $S(t)$ is periodic, smooth, and bounded between 0 and 1. Mimics oscillatory distortions in space-time.
- **Dimension growth**: $D(t)$ increases quadratically, reflecting spatial complexity over time.
- **Temporal flow**:
  - Near origin ($t \rightarrow 0$): $Tf(t) \rightarrow \frac{1}{1 + \beta \epsilon} \ll 1$
  - At large time ($t \rightarrow \infty$): $Tf(t) \rightarrow 1$

---

### üß† 5. Assumptions

- The space-time origin ($t = 0$) represents a high-density genesis point (e.g., Big Bang).
- Sinusoidal time projection models wave-like compression or energy warping.
- Temporal flow is independently modulated by proximity to the origin (not just gravity).
- The universe may be symmetric or cyclic in time with respect to $t = 0$.

---

### üåå 6. Cosmological Context

The model is inspired by:
- General Relativity (Einstein's field equations)
- Inflationary cosmology
- Cyclic and bouncing universe theories

The functions $\rho(t)$ and $Tf(t)$ can be interpreted as overlays on existing curvature models or energy-density tensors in cosmological simulations.

### üìä 7. Simulation Example

Use this Python snippet to visualize $\rho(t)$ and $Tf(t)$:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
alpha = 0.02
omega = 1
beta = 0.8
epsilon = 0.1
t = np.linspace(-12, 12, 500)

# Functions
S = 1 / (1 + np.sin(omega * t)**2)
D = 1 + alpha * t**2
rho = S * D
Tf = 1 / (1 + beta * (np.abs(t) + epsilon))

# Plot
plt.plot(t, rho, label="œÅ(t) - Time-Density")
plt.plot(t, Tf, label="Tf(t) - Temporal Flow")
plt.title("Genesis-Sphere Functions")
plt.xlabel("Time (t)")
plt.ylabel("Function Value")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
