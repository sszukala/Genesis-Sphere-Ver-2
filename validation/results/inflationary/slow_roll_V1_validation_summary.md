## AI Validation Summary: Slow Roll V1 Comparison

### Genesis-Sphere Model Configuration
- **Alpha (α)**: 0.2000 - *Spatial dimension expansion coefficient*
- **Beta (β)**: 0.8000 - *Temporal damping factor*
- **Omega (ω)**: 0.9604 - *Angular frequency*
- **Epsilon (ε)**: 0.1000 - *Zero-prevention constant*
*These parameters were optimized to best fit the inflation model.*

### Statistical Comparison
- **Correlation Coefficient**: -0.2109
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.2473
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.120106
- **Peak Time Difference**: -182 time steps

### Interpretation
The Genesis-Sphere model shows **poor correlation** with the slow roll V1 inflation model. This suggests:
- The current parameter mapping may not adequately represent this inflation model
- The time-density relationship differs significantly from this scalar field model
- Further theoretical development is needed to better align with inflationary models

### Recommendations
1. **Explore alternative functional forms** that might better capture inflationary dynamics
2. **Consider adding field-specific parameters** to the Genesis-Sphere model
3. **Test with different inflation models** to find best alignment
