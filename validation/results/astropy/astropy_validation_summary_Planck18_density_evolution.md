### Interpretation of Density Evolution Comparison
The Genesis-Sphere model shows **different density evolution characteristics** compared to the standard {astropy_model_name} model. This suggests:
- The Genesis-Sphere density function ρ(t) may capture different physics than the standard ΛCDM density parameters
- The redshift-to-time mapping may need refinement
- Further theoretical development on how Genesis-Sphere relates to matter and energy density is needed
