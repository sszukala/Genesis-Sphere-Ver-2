### Statistical Comparison
- **Correlation Coefficient**: -0.0167
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 0.3008
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.149767
- **Ekpyrotic Cycle Period**: 6.283
- **Genesis-Sphere Cycle Period**: 2.198

- **Phase Difference**: 10.416

### Interpretation
The Genesis-Sphere model shows **weak correlation** with the ekpyrotic cyclic universe model. This indicates:
- The sharp density spikes at brane collisions are challenging to model with the current functions
- The ekpyrotic model's specific contraction dynamics are not fully captured
- Modifications may be needed to better represent cycling through brane collisions

### Genesis-Sphere and Cyclic Cosmology
The inherent time-symmetry in the Genesis-Sphere model makes it particularly suitable for modeling cyclic universes. Key observations:
- The parameter ω directly controls oscillation frequency, mapping well to cosmic cycles
- Genesis-Sphere naturally produces recurring density patterns without requiring custom functions
- The model provides a simplified but effective representation of cycle dynamics

### Recommendations
1. **Extend the Genesis-Sphere model** with additional terms to better capture cyclic features
2. **Explore alternative time mappings** between the models
3. **Consider cycle-specific modifications** for this particular type of cyclic model
