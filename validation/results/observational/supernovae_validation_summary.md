## AI Validation Summary: Supernovae Dataset

### Genesis-Sphere Model Configuration
- **Alpha (α)**: 0.0200 - *Spatial dimension expansion coefficient*
- **Beta (β)**: 0.8000 - *Temporal damping factor*
- **Omega (ω)**: 1.0000 - *Angular frequency*
- **Epsilon (ε)**: 0.1000 - *Zero-prevention constant*
*These parameters are using initial values without optimization.*

### Statistical Fit Analysis
- **Chi-Square**: 182515.83
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 96
- **Reduced Chi-Square**: 1901.21

### Interpretation
The model provides a **poor fit** to the data. This suggests that:
- The Genesis-Sphere model in its current form may not adequately explain the observations
- Further theoretical development may be needed
- Alternative parameter mappings between Genesis-Sphere quantities and physical observables should be explored

### Dataset-Specific Insights
The Type Ia supernovae dataset primarily tests the model's ability to reproduce the **distance-redshift relation**, which is directly connected to the expansion history of the universe. The Genesis-Sphere time-density function ρ(t) and temporal flow function Tf(t) combine to determine this relation.

The high reduced chi-square suggests that the current mapping between Genesis-Sphere functions and luminosity distance may need refinement. Consider:
- Modifying how time (t) maps to redshift (z)
- Adjusting how density ρ(t) contributes to distance calculations
- Exploring non-linear relationships between temporal flow Tf(t) and expansion rate
### Recommendations
1. **Run parameter optimization** to find the best-fitting model parameters
2. **Perform sensitivity analysis** to understand which parameters most strongly affect the fit
3. **Compare with standard cosmological models** to benchmark performance
