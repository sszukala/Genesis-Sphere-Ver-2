### Interpretation of Temporal Flow Comparison
The Genesis-Sphere temporal flow function Tf(t) shows **weak correlation** with schwarzschild black hole time dilation. This suggests:
- The current formulation may not fully capture the precise √(1-Rs/r) relationship
- The parameter β might need adjustments to better match gravitational time dilation
- The asymptotic behavior may differ from general relativity predictions

### Theoretical Implications
The comparison between the Genesis-Sphere temporal flow function and black hole time dilation reveals important insights:
- While simpler than GR solutions, the current function may sacrifice accuracy for simplicity
- The fundamental behavior near singularities shows qualitative agreement but quantitative differences
- The high curvature regions near event horizons present the greatest modeling challenge

### Recommendations
1. **Consider extending the temporal flow function** with additional terms for better accuracy
2. **Explore alternative coordinate mappings** between r and t
3. **Test with more sophisticated black hole metrics** (e.g., Kerr-Newman)
