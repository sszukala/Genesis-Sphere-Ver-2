# üåå Genesis-Sphere: A Framework for Space-Time Density and Temporal Flow

**Author**: Shannon Szukala

## üß† Overview

**Genesis-Sphere** is a theoretical framework that extends general relativity by introducing two novel concepts:

- **Time-Density Geometry**: A model of space-time density that evolves based on sinusoidal and quadratic scaling.
- **Temporal Flow Ratio**: A mathematical formulation to simulate how time slows down or normalizes near singularities.

The goal is to provide a more accessible and visualizable way to study cosmic events like the **Big Bang**, **black holes**, and **cyclic universes**.

## üìê Key Functions

### 1. Time-Density Geometry Function

$$
\rho(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \sin^2(\omega t)} \cdot (1 + \alpha t^2)
$$

- **Sinusoidal Projection Term**: Smooths density behavior over time.
- **Dimension Expansion Term**: Models growth of spatial complexity.

---

### 2. Temporal Flow Ratio Function

$$
Tf(t) = \frac{1}{1 + \beta(|t| + \epsilon)}
$$

- Near $t = 0$, this function sharply reduces, mimicking **time dilation near singularities**.
- As $t \rightarrow \infty$, it smoothly approaches 1, simulating **normalized time flow**.

---

### 3. Derived Modulations

- **Modulated Velocity**  
  $$
  v(t) = v_0 \cdot Tf(t)
  $$

- **Modulated Pressure**  
  $$
  p(t) = p_0 \cdot \rho(t)
  $$

These scale velocity and pressure over time relative to time-density and flow modulation.

## üìä Sample Visualization (Python)

Use this Python script to plot the behavior of $\rho(t)$ and $Tf(t)$.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
alpha = 0.02
omega = 1
beta = 0.8
epsilon = 0.1
t = np.linspace(-12, 12, 500)

# Functions
S = 1 / (1 + np.sin(omega * t)**2)
D = 1 + alpha * t**2
rho = S * D
Tf = 1 / (1 + beta * (np.abs(t) + epsilon))

# Plot
plt.plot(t, rho, label="œÅ(t) - Time-Density")
plt.plot(t, Tf, label="Tf(t) - Temporal Flow")
plt.title("Genesis-Sphere Functions")
plt.xlabel("Time (t)")
plt.ylabel("Function Value")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## üé¨ Animation Features

Genesis-Sphere includes animation capabilities to visualize how the model's key functions evolve over time:

1. **Static Visualization**: Basic plots showing function relationships using `genesis_sphere_simulation.py`

2. **Video Animation**: Dynamic visualization of function evolution using `genesis_sphere_animation_fallback.py`

3. **Frame Sequences**: Individual image frames showing the progression over time

Note: Video animation requires FFmpeg to be installed. The framework will automatically check for FFmpeg and offers an alternative frame-by-frame visualization if not found.

```bash
# Run from the simulations directory
python genesis_sphere_animation_fallback.py
```

## üåê 3D/4D Visualizations

The framework now includes advanced 3D and 4D visualizations to provide deeper insights into the Genesis-Sphere model:

1. **3D Surface Plot**: Shows space-time density variation across time and frequency parameters
   
2. **3D Parametric Curve**: Traces the evolution of the system in 3D space (time, density, velocity)
   
3. **4D Visualization**: Uses 3D coordinates with color as the fourth dimension to represent pressure
   
4. **Space-Time Folding**: Visualizes how space-time might fold near a singularity

```bash
# Generate all 3D/4D visualizations
python simulations/genesis_sphere_3d_visualization.py
```

### Static Visualizations

#### 2D Function Plots
![Basic Simulation Output](output/simulation_output.png)
*Basic simulation output showing the core Genesis-Sphere functions: sinusoidal projection, dimension expansion, space-time density, temporal flow, and derived quantities (velocity and pressure).*

#### 3D Surface Plot
![3D Density Surface](output/3d_density_surface.png)
*3D visualization of space-time density (œÅ) as a function of time (t) and frequency (œâ). The peaks and valleys represent regions of high and low density in the model's space-time fabric.*

#### 3D Parametric Curve
![3D Parametric Curve](output/3d_parametric_curve.png)
*This 3D parametric curve traces the evolution of the system through space-time. The path shows how density (œÅ) and velocity (v) change across time (t), revealing the trajectory of physical quantities through the model universe.*

#### 4D Visualization
![4D Visualization](output/4d_visualization.png)
*A 4D visualization using color as the fourth dimension. The 3D scatter plot shows points in (t, œÅ, v) space, with color representing pressure. This allows us to visualize four variables simultaneously.*

#### Space-Time Folding
![Space-Time Folding](output/3d_spacetime_folding.png)
*Visualization of space-time folding near a singularity. This surface represents how temporal distortion manifests in spatial dimensions, creating a "warped" geometry that affects the flow of time.*

### Animated Visualizations

The following animations provide dynamic visualizations of the Genesis-Sphere model:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

*This animation shows a rotating view of the space-time density surface, providing a comprehensive visualization of how density varies across time and frequency dimensions. The rotation gives a better understanding of the 3D structure.*

#### 3D Parametric Curve Animation
<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="output/3d_parametric_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</video>

*The parametric curve animation first gradually reveals the evolution path through (t, œÅ, v) space, then rotates to show the three-dimensional structure from different angles. This helps visualize how the system evolves over time.*

#### Space-Time Folding Animation
<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="output/spacetime_folding_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

*This animation demonstrates how space-time folding changes as the Œ≤ parameter increases. The surface becomes more sharply folded near the origin, visualizing stronger time dilation effects. The animation also rotates to show the folding from different perspectives.*

#### 4D Visualization with Pressure Wave
<video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="output/4d_visualization_animation.mp4" type="video/mp4">

*The 4D animation shows an oscillating pressure wave moving through the system, visualized as changing colors in the point cloud. The animation rotates to provide different viewing angles of this 4D phenomenon.*

## üîÑ Generating All Visualizations
